<h1>Escape (The Pi単a Colada Song)</h1>
</page>
So I waited with high hopes
And she walked in the place
I knew her smile in an instant
I knew the curve of her face
It was my own lovely lady
And she said, "Oh, it's you"
<br>
Then we laughed for a moment
And I said, "I never knew"
"That you like pi単a coladas
And gettin' caught in the rain
And the feel of the ocean
</br>
<br>
And the taste of champagne
If you like making love at midnight
In the dunes on the cape
You're the lady I've looked for
Come with me and escape"
</br>
<br>
If you like pi単a coladas
And gettin' caught in the rain
If you're not into yoga
If you have half a brain
If you like making love at midnight
</br>
<br>
In the dunes on the cape
I'm the love that you've looked for
Write to me and escape
Yes, I like pi単a coladas
And gettin' caught in the rain
</br>
<br>
I'm not much into health food
I am into champagne
I've got to meet you by tomorrow noon
And cut through all this red tape
At a bar called O'Malley's
</br>
<br>It was my own lovely lady
And she said, "Oh, it's you"
Then we laughed for a moment
And I said, "I never knew"
